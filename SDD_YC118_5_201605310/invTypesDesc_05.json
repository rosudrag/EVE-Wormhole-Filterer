The Palatine Keepstar is being offered under terms of a highly encrypted construction template that will limit the number that can be built and operated at any given time.\r\n\r\nLike the standard Keepstar, the Palatine Keepstar has been built with new spaceship tethering technology as standard, and it will accommodate all size classes of ship, including 'supercapital' vessels, in its internal docking bays. The defensive capabilities of the Palatine Keepstar are formidable and are highly enhanced in lower security star systems with the ability to mount area effect and 'doomsday' weapons. The Palatine Keepstar can be configured using Upwell's Standup brand service and structure modules so as to serve the specific needs of the structure operator.

Its on-board processor interfaces with a forward-facing sensor suite, instantly recognizing vehicles, devices, and personal armor based on microscopic manufacturer's tags. The beam, a bi-channel “hollow laser”, simultaneously acts as both a containment field and transport medium for the nanite swarm, which works to sift unwanted particles from the structure, undo ionization, and reconstruct the atomic patterns of the material.\n\nThe repair tool has several design innovations, the most surprising probably being the incorporation of Amarr focusing crystal technology.

During the pre-fire charge, the forward armature locks into position, stabilizing the magnetic field and helping to shield the user from backscatter and the excessive heat produced.

Its on-board processor interfaces with a forward-facing sensor suite, instantly recognizing vehicles, devices, and personal armor based on microscopic manufacturer's tags. The beam, a bi-channel “hollow laser”, simultaneously acts as both a containment field and transport medium for the nanite swarm, which works to sift unwanted particles from the structure, undo ionization, and reconstruct the atomic patterns of the material. \n\nThe repair tool has several design innovations, the most surprising probably being the incorporation of Amarr focusing crystal technology. Beyond that, the device also makes use of an advanced K7 nano static co-processor on par with Caldari planet side missile tracking systems and a 55x5 reverse current power cell configuration rarely used beyond self-sustaining Gallente drone units. The result is an elegant tool combining the best technology from several very different design philosophies.",0,0.01,0,1,null,1125,null,null,0.01,null,null,null,null,null,0],
