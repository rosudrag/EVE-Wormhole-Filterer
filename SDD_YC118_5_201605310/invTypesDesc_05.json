The Palatine Keepstar is being offered under terms of a highly encrypted construction template that will limit the number that can be built and operated at any given time.\r\n\r\nLike the standard Keepstar, the Palatine Keepstar has been built with new spaceship tethering technology as standard, and it will accommodate all size classes of ship, including 'supercapital' vessels, in its internal docking bays. The defensive capabilities of the Palatine Keepstar are formidable and are highly enhanced in lower security star systems with the ability to mount area effect and 'doomsday' weapons. The Palatine Keepstar can be configured using Upwell's Standup brand service and structure modules so as to serve the specific needs of the structure operator.
